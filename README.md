# Cricket Scoreboard

The Cricket Scoreboard System is a Java GUI project that utilizes Swings and AWT libraries to create an interactive user interface for recording ball-to-ball information during a live cricket match. The project incorporates SQL database connectivity through JDBC drivers to store and retrieve the recorded data. This system aims to assist match analysts and statisticians in maintaining accurate and real-time records of cricket matches.
